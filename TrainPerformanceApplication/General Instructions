Question:  Assume that you receive a feed in a “TrainDetails.txt” (you need to refer the flat file attached in the mail) from an external system and the file contains TrainType, Speed(KMPH), Energy(KWH). Note that each column/field is separated by delimiter ‘-’ as given in the file. Can you write a stand-alone java program to read the file and load/store into in-memory (do not use any database) and can you display below details upon user enters the train type as the input?
(i)	Print the lowest speed for the train type or print ‘No details found’ for invalid train type.
(ii)	Print the highest energy consumption and the speed details or print ‘No details found’ for invalid train type.
